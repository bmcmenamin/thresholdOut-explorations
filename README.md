# thresholdOut-explorations

Testing Dwork's resuable holdout on grid-search

## `./original_method`

This folder contains the a python reimplementation of Dwork's method that was published as [The reusable holdout: Preserving validity in adaptive data analysis](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6248/636) and originally hoster [here](https://github.com/andyljones/thresholdout)

## Testing it out on grid search

The notebook linked [here](https://github.com/bmcmenamin/thresholdOut-explorations/blob/master/Threshold%20out%20demos%20--%20tuning%20parameters%20for%20linear%20regression.ipynb) walks through an experiment showing `thresholdOut` being applied in a more typical grid-search supervised learning context.
More discussion is availabe on my blog post [here](https://bmcmenamin.github.io/2017/07/02/grid-search-with-the-reusable.html)
